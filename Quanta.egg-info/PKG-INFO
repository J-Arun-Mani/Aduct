Description: Quanta is a toolkit to design graphical applications that can be
        dynamically changed with a little work as possible. It is designed by
        inheriting objects provided by `Gtk <http://www.gtk.org>`__ and thus by
        following principles of Quanta with Gtk, one can make powerful
        applications that are easy for a developer to develop, third-party
        person to improve and end user to use.
