Aduct is a toolkit to design graphical applications that can be
dynamically changed with a little work as possible. It is designed by
inheriting objects provided by `Gtk <http://www.gtk.org>`__ and thus by
following principles of Aduct with Gtk, one can make powerful
applications that are easy for a developer to develop, third-party
person to improve and end user to use.
